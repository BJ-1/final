# Autonomous Car Dilemma

This program is a simple implementation of classes using Object-Oriented Programming in c++.
The program deals with an issue where a self driving car needs to make a decision in a seemingly 
impossible situation. There is a truck in front a self-driving vehicle, and the vehicle is to 
recognize that the load on the truck is about to fall on it. The self-driving vehicle is in between
two motorcycles on the road in a way that there is no option but hit either one of the motorcycles.

The self-driving vehicle is then to make the most ethical decision that minimizes the damage as well.
